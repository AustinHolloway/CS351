    <h1>Here a little more about me!</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hello Proffesor Mckinley!!
      <br> Im originally from Vancouver, WA.
      <br>
      <br> I played sports my entire life.
      <br>
      <br> I went to Union high school.
      <br>
      <br> During my life at central I switched majors twice before finding Computer science which I really enjoy.
      <br>
      <br> This is my last quarter at Central Washington University!
      <br>
      <br> I'm sending resumes everywhere hoping to get my foot in the door somewhere to begin my career as a real adult lol.
      <br>
      <br> Even after college im going to continue to study, I'd like to end up working with nanobot in the medical field to help eleminate all sorts of disease.
      <br>
      <br> I also took CS450 with you and CS380.
      <br>
      <br> In my CS481 class my group and I made an andriod app where when you enter a new location you would be able to chat to everyone in that zone (100x100 miles) and design your profile.
