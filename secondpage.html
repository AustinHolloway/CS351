      <br> So a little more about me.
      <br>
      <br> I played 18 seasons of football 
      <br>
      <br> To aggressive for soccer so that was the switch to football
      <br>
      <br> Baseball was to boring for me.
      <br>
      <br> Never played basketball competitively but always down for pig or a game with friends.
      <br>
      <br> Wrestled for 5 years.
      <br>
      <br> Track for 4 years.
      <br>
      <br> Played lacross for one year then I switched to rugby for the last two years in high school. By far my favorite sport to play!
      <br>
      <br> I have an older sister and a younger sister! youngest is having a baby and shes having a baby girl, I personally was hoping for a boy lol.
      <br>
      <br> My younger Sister and I out elk hunting last year with my family.
